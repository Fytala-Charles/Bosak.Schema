# Bosak.Schema Feature Requests

> Current public schema scope, status and acceptance boundaries.


## 1. Registry

| Request | Status | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Apache/public transition | Implemented and GitHub publication verified | Schema-only Apache-2.0; activation-free services; private infrastructure excluded |
| [REQ-009](ADR-005-xsd11-compiled-model-and-validation.md) staged XSD 1.1 support | In Progress | Compiled descriptors, assertion/facet evaluation, alternative applicability/filtering and selected metadata |
| Core schema-session integration | Pending | Complete component authority, actual PSVI/atomic flow, compatible-schema interchange and real consumer qualification |
| Complete XSD 1.1 structural validation | Incomplete | No complete current implementation or blanket conformance claim |

## 2. Implemented Coverage

The public tests cover XSD version selection, schema components, explicit resolution/security, assertion evaluation, simple-type assertion facets, alternative compilation/applicability, open-content/default-attribute descriptor handling, open-content wildcard negative constraints (notNamespace/notQName) and the existing typed-XSLT integration. Support is bounded by those implementations and diagnostics; recorded metadata is not equivalent to structural enforcement.

## 3. Acceptance and Exclusions

The Apache transition passed 114 public schema tests with zero failures/skips. Commercial credential, payments, delivery and key-generation requests remain in the private licensing repository; they are not public schema dependencies or open-source engine features.

The transition does not implement the proposed core session API, change frozen W3C gates, admit skipped tests, certify XmlDb/Braid adoption or release a package. Future semantic additions require immutable specification adoption evidence and happy-path/edge regression tests.
