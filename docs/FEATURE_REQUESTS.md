# Bosak.Schema Feature Requests

> Current public schema scope, status and acceptance boundaries.


## 1. Registry

| Request | Status | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Apache/public transition | Implemented and GitHub publication verified | Schema-only Apache-2.0; activation-free services; private infrastructure excluded |
| REQ-009 staged XSD 1.1 support | In Progress | Compiled descriptors, assertion/facet evaluation, alternative applicability/filtering and selected metadata |
| Core schema-session integration | Pending | Complete component authority, actual PSVI/atomic flow, compatible-schema interchange and real consumer qualification |
| Native document assessment (REQ-009, 0.7 candidate) | Implemented candidate | Finite required/optional/repeated particles, exact decimals/assertions, original occurrence state and typed whole-document exports |
| Complete XSD 1.1 structural validation | Incomplete | One native profile does not establish complete coverage or conformance |

## 2. Implemented Coverage

The public tests cover XSD version selection, schema components, explicit resolution/security, assertion evaluation, simple-type assertion facets, alternative compilation/applicability, open-content/default-attribute descriptor handling and the existing typed-XSLT integration. Support is bounded by those implementations and diagnostics; recorded metadata is not equivalent to structural enforcement.

## 3. Acceptance and Exclusions

The Apache transition passed 114 public schema tests with zero failures/skips. Commercial credential, payments, delivery and key-generation requests remain in the private licensing repository; they are not public schema dependencies or open-source engine features.

The transition does not implement the proposed core session API, change frozen W3C gates, admit skipped tests, certify XmlDb/Braid adoption or release a package. Future semantic additions require immutable specification adoption evidence and happy-path/edge regression tests.

## 4. Native Assessment Acceptance Scope

The [0.5 candidate](DOCUMENT-ASSESSMENT.md) implements `decimal-sequence-assertions-v1` under [ADR-008](ADR-008-bounded-native-assessment.md) and pre-implementation [immutable normative adoption](ASSESSMENT-ADOPTION-2026-10-29.md). All 191 source cases pass, including 77 new happy/error/unsupported/boundary/copy/concurrency cases, on published and current core. The 114 legacy test binaries pass with the new library. Source/API additions are candidate work, not package publication, native product adoption or general API freeze.

The broader REQ-009 remains In Progress. Anonymous-root projection, general component closure, compatible universes, named/anonymous/list/union derivation and broader structural features remain acceptance work. No core REQ-139 completion or frozen skip removal is inferred.

## Whole-document bridge candidate — 29 October 2026

The unpublished core 1.34.0 provider bridge now carries original anonymous-root and decimal-child state through whole-document exports and preserve/strip copies. Root atomization raises FOTY0012; stale content and legacy reassessment refuse explicitly. Use `-p:BosakSourceRoot=D:/Development/Bosak` for builds/tests/examples because candidate package dependencies are unpublished. See [the current guide](DOCUMENT-ASSESSMENT.md). The earlier 191-case receipts describe the historical projection-only checkpoint; fresh bridge qualification is recorded separately in the core `docs/schema-document-bridge` dossier. Broader coverage, consumer adoption and API freeze remain pending. No commit/push/tag/publication.

## Reviewed whole-document bridge — 29 October 2026

The optional provider attachment API now checks a replacement completely before removing the previous binding. Failed replacement retains original state and stale-content refusal; failed initial attachment leaves the node unregistered. The trusted host must supply immutable state and the correct assessed value. This API carries that state without performing schema validation. The finite native profile is unchanged; optional children and general API freeze remain pending. Current core candidate is unpublished 1.34.0; use the BosakSourceRoot override. New review qualification lives in the core `docs/schema-document-bridge/api-review` dossier, separately from historical assessment receipts.

Post-review verification: **24,209 core tests pass in one complete solution run**, **204 Schema tests pass**, and all six focused provider attachment cases pass. Release build: zero warnings/errors. QT3 **31,397/0/424**, qt4 **8,941/0/1,918** (230 gated sets, 11 experimental passes), with exact skip mappings unchanged. The full-document example retains original root state and passes typed-value and preserve/strip checks. Prior sealed assessment, bridge and integration receipts remain unchanged.

## Optional decimal child scope — 29 October 2026

The [new adoption record](OPTIONAL-DECIMAL-ADOPTION-2026-10-29.md) and [implementation plan](OPTIONAL-DECIMAL-PLAN.md) define the next finite extension. It is not implemented. Keep occurrence bounds on particles, actual element states only for present nodes, and use effective Boolean conversion for empty assertion results. Maximum occurrence stays one; no broader grammar/session admission. Proposed implementation version is Schema 0.6; this documentation step keeps 0.5 and core 1.34.0 unchanged. Fresh baseline: 204 Schema tests pass. Core solution/gates inherit the source-identical `a163ff11` checkpoint. No REQ completion or publication.

Scope refinement: a thirteenth isolated observation exposes ignorable-whitespace removal being refused for an empty element-only assessed root. Supporting all-optional-absent documents therefore needs a bounded provider binding correction. The future implementation proposes core patch 1.34.1 plus fresh complete core tests and exact conformance gates; current versions and production source stay unchanged. Both the initial twelve and extended thirteen-observation receipts are preserved in the optional-child dossier; they overlap.

## Optional decimal scope delivery — 29 October 2026

See the [synchronized checkpoint](OPTIONAL-DECIMAL-CHECKPOINT.md) for current delivery identity and remote target. Documentation is prepared for the user-authorized commit/push; optional-child semantics are not implemented. Current versions/pins and production source remain unchanged. Thirteen observations and 204 passing Schema baseline cases support the scope; the core suite/gates are inherited. Next: implement the bounded plan and its core binding correction with fresh required qualification.

## Optional decimal implementation candidate — 29 October 2026

Current behavior: [Schema 0.6 optional assessment](OPTIONAL-DECIMAL-IMPLEMENTATION.md), with core 1.34.1 and required local source override. Local zero-or-one particles, ordered matching, assertion EBV and present-only original state are implemented; required-only v1 remains and optional schemas use v2. Empty element-only root whitespace normalization is corrected while real/decimal mutation refusal remains. The complete Schema suite passes 260 cases, including 56 new optional cases; the full-document example retains later declaration identity. Earlier planned-scope/version notices are historical. Broader REQ-009/general session/API freeze and consumer acceptance remain pending. Original public checkout and product pins are unchanged; implementation is uncommitted and unpublished.

Fresh final qualification: **24,214 complete core tests pass** (including 8,196 XSLT and 212 provider cases), **260 complete Schema tests pass** (56 new optional cases), normal QT3 **31,397/0/424**, qt4 **8,941/0/1,918**, 230 gated sets and 11 experimental passes. Exact skip names/reasons match the sealed integration checkpoint. Core build has zero errors and five warnings in unchanged Standard test/XSLT conformance sources; no new warning source is introduced. The optional-gap whole-document example and strict Schema documentation check pass. Original 45-case before evidence is 9 passed/36 failed; all 45 now pass alongside eleven added boundary cases. Five new core cases cover the root binding correction.

## Optional decimal review checkpoint — 29 October 2026

Current delivery: [reviewed optional implementation](OPTIONAL-DECIMAL-REVIEW.md), Schema 0.6/core 1.34.1. No further production fix was needed; source matches tested qualification. The user authorized checkpoint commit/push; original uncommitted notices are capture-time history. Next: scope repetitions separately before implementation. Full schema/session/API freeze and product adoption remain pending.

## Bounded repeated decimal scope — 29 October 2026

The [repetition adoption](REPEATED-DECIMAL-ADOPTION-2026-10-29.md) and [implementation plan](REPEATED-DECIMAL-PLAN.md) define the next slice. Repetitions are not implemented. The reviewed optional source is checkpointed at Schema `773fd69` / core `5e277c6a`; current Schema 0.6/core 1.34.1 remain unchanged. Sixteen diagnostic observations cover current refusal and real-engine comparison cardinality, not native repetition acceptance. Proposed Schema 0.7/v3 keeps grammar and public overloads unchanged, bounds total occurrences, preserves original state, handles known cardinality errors and refuses ambiguous singular projection. Broader API/session acceptance remains pending.

## Bounded repeated decimal candidate — 29 October 2026

Current behavior: [Schema 0.7/v3 repetition implementation](REPEATED-DECIMAL-IMPLEMENTATION.md). Local minimum zero/one, maximum and total budget up to sixteen, contiguous ordered states, shared original declarations, narrow XPTY0004 assertion failure and ambiguous singular projection refusal are implemented. Required-only v1 and optional v2 remain; broader grammar is refused. Fresh complete Schema tests: 334 passes (74 new). Build/example pass; unchanged core 1.34.1 full/gate evidence is inherited after source checks. Earlier planned-scope/version notices describe earlier capture. General schema/session acceptance and product adoption remain pending. Source changes are uncommitted and unpublished.

Final repeated-candidate qualification: **334 complete Schema cases pass**, including **74 new repetition/error-boundary cases**. The original 57-case before cohort (17 passed/40 failed) now all passes; seventeen further boundary/safety cases also pass. The prior 260-case suite retains 259 unchanged passing expectations and one explicitly adopted maxOccurs-two coverage/profile update. Schema source-override Release build: **zero warnings/errors**. The repeated-document XPath/XSLT example and strict Schema docs check pass. Core source/tests/harness/fixture references and build configuration are unchanged from the reviewed source, so **24,214 core passes**, QT3 **31,397/0/424** and qt4 **8,941/0/1,918** (230 sets) are inherited, not fresh full runs. Exact raw source/receipt identities and all earlier sealed dossiers are preserved.

## Repetition implementation review checkpoint — 29 October 2026

Current delivery: [reviewed Schema 0.7 implementation](REPEATED-DECIMAL-REVIEW.md), with unchanged core 1.34.1. No further production fix was needed; tested source identities and 334-case qualification match. Review/checkpoint is user-authorized. Count assertion support will be a separate adoption/plan; it is not implemented now. Earlier uncommitted notices describe original capture. General API/session acceptance and product adoption remain pending.

## Count assertion scope — 29 October 2026

The [count adoption](COUNT-ASSERTION-ADOPTION-2026-10-29.md), [source locks](COUNT-ASSERTION-SOURCES.json) and [plan](COUNT-ASSERTION-PLAN.md) define the next slice. Unprefixed count(DeclaredChildName) is proposed; no count grammar is implemented yet. Prefixed calls/aliases and wider functions remain Unsupported, and bare count child names retain selection semantics. Current Schema 0.7/core 1.34.1 source is unchanged from reviewed qualification. Schema 0.8/v4 is a proposed future target. Native structure/exact-value validation, original state and copy semantics remain mandatory before assertions. No API freeze or release.
