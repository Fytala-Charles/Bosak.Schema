# Bosak.Schema Integration

> Use schema services without activation and with explicit supported coverage.


## 1. Dependency and Availability

Build this source with .NET 10. The project references Bosak XPath API/providers, XSLT and XQuery 1.26.3. The source transition targets the 0.4 development line through MinVer; no new NuGet release or tag is claimed.

## 2. Compile and Validate

```csharp
using System.Xml.Linq;
using Bosak.Schema;

var options = SchemaCompileOptions.Default(XsdLanguageVersion.Xsd11);
var compiler = SchemaServices.CreateSchemaCompiler();
using var stream = File.OpenRead("schema.xsd");
var schema = compiler.Compile(stream, new Uri(Path.GetFullPath("schema.xsd")), options);
var result = SchemaServices.CreateValidationService()
    .Validate(schema, XElement.Load("candidate.xml"));
```

Always inspect compile/validation diagnostics and the [coverage status](FEATURE_REQUESTS.md). A successful supported assertion evaluation is not a claim of complete XSD 1.1 structural validation. The stream compiler prohibits DTD resolution; imports/includes require an explicit `ISchemaResourceResolver`. The caller owns its input stream/tree.

## 3. Schema-Aware XSLT

`SchemaAwareXslt.CreateCompiler()` enables the existing schema-aware compiler path. Its directory overload preserves the existing resolver behavior; pass an appropriate directory and resource policy for your host. This path still uses the core's established `XmlSchemaSet` integration and does not turn it into a complete XSD 1.1 processor.

## 4. Activation Migration

Remove `License.Activate(...)` from new applications. Existing binaries can retain that call: the public shim ignores the supplied value, stores no credential and never contacts a service. `IsActivated` is always true; `Current` is a perpetual Apache compatibility marker. It grants no entitlement to any other Fytala product. `GracePeriod`, `ActivatedLicense`, `LicenseTier` and `LicenseValidationException` remain legacy compatibility shapes, without schema access enforcement.

The new package contains no internal HMAC/product key, signing implementation, key issuer, billing pipeline or private deployment configuration. Those remain private infrastructure. Do not use the shim to authorize another product.

## 5. Version History and Limitations

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| 2026-10-29 | Owner-approved Apache-2.0/public schema-only source, activation-free factories and credential-free compatibility shim; 114 tests pass |
| Before transition | Private proprietary development, preserved separately with its original Git history |

Public factory/type signatures are retained, with the intentional licensing behavior change documented above. Real previously compiled consumer replacement tests and full schema-session ABI/provider acceptance are not certified by these source tests.
