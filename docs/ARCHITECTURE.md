# Bosak.Schema Architecture

> Modular Apache schema services with explicit resource and engine boundaries.


## 1. Current Architecture

One public `Bosak.Schema` assembly references the published Bosak XPath API/providers, XSLT and XQuery packages at 1.26.3. The core engine does not reference this package. Keeping schema services in a separate assembly avoids a dependency cycle; changing the license does not require merging them into Core.

## 2. Components

| Component | Responsibility and limit |
|---|---|
| `Compilation` | Explicit-version schema descriptor compilation and bounded resolved imports/includes |
| `Model` | Staged XSD 1.1 assertions, alternatives, declarations, simple facets, open-content/default-attribute metadata, wildcard negative constraints (notNamespace/notQName) |
| `Validation` | Assertion/facet evaluation and supported governing-type applicability through Bosak XPath |
| `SchemaServices` | Activation-free factories for compiler and validation services |
| `SchemaAwareXslt` | Opt-in helper for the existing schema-aware XSLT path |
| Legacy license DTO/shim types | API compatibility only; no credential implementation or authority |

The separate private licensing repository retains key issuers, payments, delivery/deployment services and historical commercial code. None is referenced by the public solution.

## 3. Identity and Integration Limits

The current compiled root-document digest is a legacy identifier, not proof of a complete schema-component universe. Full compatible-universe/PSVI session integration remains a separate design and provider qualification task. No new core session API is accepted by this licensing change.

Schema language version, host/XDM profile, component authority and source/snapshot identity must remain distinct in future integration. Preserve original PSVI across compatible schemas; QName or digest equality alone must not authenticate a component authority.

## 4. Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Status |
|---|---|
| [ADR-007: Apache/public schema split](ADR-007-apache-schema-publication.md) | Accepted by owner on 29 October 2026 |
| [ADR-005: XSD 1.1 compiled model and validation pipeline](ADR-005-xsd11-compiled-model-and-validation.md) | Accepted by owner on 27 October 2026; transferred to the public repository 30 October 2026 as REQ-009 decision evidence |
| [ADR-006: XSD 1.1 S4/S5 engine seam compatibility](ADR-006-xsd11-engine-seam-compatibility.md) | Proposed; pending core-repo acceptance before the S4 design freeze (core tracking REQ-139) |
| Preserve modular package and core dependency direction | Retained |
| Require no activation for standards processing | Implemented |
| Full XSD 1.1 provider/session integration | Pending; no conformance promotion |

## 5. Validation and Extensibility

All 124 public schema tests pass. Existing assertion, facet, alternative, resource-policy and typed-XSLT regression bodies are retained; commercial credential tests remain with the private infrastructure. New tests cover activation-free factories, valid/invalid assertions, ignored legacy activation, invalid directory input, absence of issuer/credential implementations and wildcard negative-constraint recording.

No new engine implementation, baseline/filter change, storage migration or consumer adoption is included. Registry reclamation, full PSVI/component completeness and real consumer ABI qualification remain future acceptance gates.
